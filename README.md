# Rules
press either 1 or 2 to give a either a char or a sentence.
If the char is contained inside of the word you have to seek it will give you
the amount you spinned x the amount it contained and you will have an aditional
turn.
If you guessed it wrong you skip your turn and get nothing.
If you presse 2 you will have to give a sentence, but we wanted to be nice.
Therfor you will only pass your turn if you failled.
Otherwise you win the round.

The player with the most money wins the whole game.

Good luck
